## Todo

[ ] Implement mysql
[ ] Make mysql optional
[ ] use libasynql or something to make the querys async (i myself will not be doing this.)
[ ] Make it so server owners can disable self claiming bounties.
[ ] Possible introduction to GUi's or Forms (i just dont want to have to use a composer cuz i suck at that stuff
